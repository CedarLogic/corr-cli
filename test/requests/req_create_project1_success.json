	"description":"The Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) is a novel data science approach for solving multiscale materials science problems. It uses techniques from physics, machine learning, regression analysis, signal processing, and spatial statistics to create structure-property-processing relationships. The MKS carries the potential to bridge multiple length scales using localization and homogenization linkages, and provides a data driven framework for solving inverse material design problems.",
	"goals":"The Materials Knowledge Materials in Python (PyMKS) framework is an object oriented set of tools and examples written in Python that provide high level access to the MKS framework for rapid creation and analysis of structure-property-processing relationships. A short intoduction of how to use PyMKS is outlined below and example cases can be found in the examples section. Both code and example contributions are welcome.",
